serialport-dot-py
=

A wrapper around the PySerial SerialPort object that handles threading and provides customizable incoming data handling.
serialport-dot-py takes the great work of pyserial and makes it easier to use python to get your serial port rocking.  

The project uses a simple .cfg file for configuring your serial port, which allows you to specify things like the port's 
name and baudrate.

Some Sample Code
=

from serialport import SerialPort<br>
myPort = SerialPort()<br>
myPort.sendBytes(someByteArray)<br>


That's it.
